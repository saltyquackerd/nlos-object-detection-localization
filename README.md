# NLOS Object Detection & Localization

This repository implements machine learning models for **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)** object detection â€” focusing on both **classification** (identifying the object) and **localization** (pinpointing its position) using indirect signal data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Develop models capable of detecting and localizing objects hidden from direct view using NLOS data.
- Compare multiple modeling strategies for classification and localization.
- Provide reusable code, experiment notebooks, and a pre-trained checkpoint for quick inference.
